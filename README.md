# Logger
Again a minimal and small application made in a few hours for myself. Solves my personal problem of daily logging.
Replacement to ma-movie because ma-movie's ui was too complex and boring to archive a simle task.

Logger is simple to use and looks nice

Features to be added in future

- Catagories
- Dark Theme
- Delete log feature
- Edit log feature
- Log time from now
- Refetch logs after every minute
- Circular backup of logger database
- Compare time gap b/w different logs
etc.
